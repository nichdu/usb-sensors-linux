# Description #

This space is about software for different sensors that can be connected to Linux environment.

Currently there is software to get data from Lascar EL-USB-RT (Temp/Hum) and Voltcraft CO-20 (Air Quality) USB sensors. The goal is to make as simple as possible utilities that only collect the value from the USB sensor, so that other software/scripts can use it for processing.
